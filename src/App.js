        Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician whose calculations of
        orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the
        first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 33-year career
        at NASA and its predecessor, she earned a reputation for mastering
        complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to
        perform the tasks. The space agency noted her "historical role as one of
        the first African-American women to work as a NASA scientist".
